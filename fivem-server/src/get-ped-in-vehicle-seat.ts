 * 0x388FDE9A

 * If there is no ped in the seat, and the game considers the vehicle as ambient population, this will create a random occupant ped in the seat, which may be cleaned up by the game fairly soon if not marked as script-owned mission entity.
 * Seat indexes:
 * -1 = Driver
 * 0 = Front Right Passenger
 * 1 = Back Left Passenger
 * 2 = Back Right Passenger
 * 3 = Further Back Left Passenger (vehicles > 4 seats)
 * 4 = Further Back Right Passenger (vehicles > 4 seats)
 * etc.
 * If p2 is true it uses a different GetOccupant function.
