 * CFX:SET_PLAYER_CONTROL
 *
 * 0xD17AFCD8

 * This command can be used to temporarily disable the playerâ€™s controls. The controls should be switched back on again as soon as possible.
 * NOTE Turning this on will make vehicles proof from bullets etc. Likewise when the player controls are turned back on it will make ALL the vehicles vunerable again,
 * so you will have to set them back with SET_CAR_CAN_BE_DAMAGED(vehicle_name, FALSE).
 * Flags:
 * SPC_AMBIENT_SCRIPT = (1 << 1),
 * SPC_CLEAR_TASKS = (1 << 2),
 * SPC_REMOVE_FIRES = (1 << 3),
 * SPC_REMOVE_EXPLOSIONS = (1 << 4),
 * SPC_REMOVE_PROJECTILES = (1 << 5),
 * SPC_DEACTIVATE_GADGETS = (1 << 6),
 * SPC_REENABLE_CONTROL_ON_DEATH = (1 << 7),
 * SPC_LEAVE_CAMERA_CONTROL_ON = (1 << 8),
 * SPC_ALLOW_PLAYER_DAMAGE = (1 << 9),
 * SPC_DONT_STOP_OTHER_CARS_AROUND_PLAYER = (1 << 10),
 * SPC_PREVENT_EVERYBODY_BACKOFF = (1 << 11),
 * SPC_ALLOW_PAD_SHAKE = (1 << 12)
