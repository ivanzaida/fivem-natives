 * TASK:ADD_COVER_POINT
 *
 * 0xBE006B266746B58A

 * NOTE: To take the coordinates of a cover point you'd like to create, do the following:
 * Stand behind the object you'd like to take cover behind.
 * Face towards the object you're standing behind.
 * If you do it this way then the following is true:
 * The heading that is output to your temp_debug.txt is the 'FLOAT direction'
 * Another thing to bear in mind is:
 * When setting COVERPOINT_USAGE, COVUSE_WALLTOLEFT will flip the ped out to his right hand side, and so COVUSE_WALLTORIGHT will flip the ped out to his left.
