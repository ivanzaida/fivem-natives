 * WEAPON:CREATE_AIR_DEFENCE_SPHERE
 *
 * 0x51817FD0EC0A289C

 * Any bullets, projectiles or air vehicles that enter this sphere will be destroyed/exploded.
 * Weapon is used to trigger a shot/VFX aimed at the sphere intersection position of any bullets/projectiles to look like they're being shot down.
 * If no weapon hash passed in, sphere will not fire at vehicles, and bullets/projectiles will only be deleted.
 * Peds inside the sphere will enter the weapon blocked state when trying to aim.
 * MAX_AIR_DEFENCE_ZONES = 10, speak to Blair Trusler/David Hynd if this needs increasing.
 * Creates an air defence sphere at the defined position.
 * Both coordinates are from objects in the decompiled scripts. Native related to 0xECDC202B25E5CF48 p1 value. The only weapon hash used in the decompiled scripts is weapon_air_defence_gun. These two natives are used by the yacht script, decompiled scripts suggest it and the weapon hash used (valkyrie's rockets) are also used by yachts.
