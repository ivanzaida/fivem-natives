/**
 * PED:CREATE_GROUP
 *
 * 0xAE734C5C560DD787

 * Every frame, the code automatically removes any group which doesn't have any leader/members.
 * This means that you have to set a group leader in the same frame as the group is created, as otherwise you'll get an assert about the group ID being out of range (i.e. the group doesn't exist)
 * The Player already has a group so a group doens't need to be created for them.
 * Creates a new ped group.
 * Groups can contain up to 8 peds.
 * The parameter is unused.
 * Returns a handle to the created group, or 0 if a group couldn't be created.
