 * ENTITY:FIND_ANIM_EVENT_PHASE
 *
 * 0xA2A6AE50772C4FDB

 * Use this to find an event tag in an animation and get it's start and end phase.
 * In the script "player_scene_t_bbfight.c4":
 * "if (ENTITY::FIND_ANIM_EVENT_PHASE(&l_16E, &l_19F[v_4/16/], v_9, &v_A, &v_B))"
 * -- &l_16E (p0) is requested as an anim dictionary earlier in the script.
 * -- &l_19F[v_4/16/] (p1) is used in other natives in the script as the "animation" param.
 * -- v_9 (p2) is instantiated as "victim_fall"; I'm guessing that's another anim
 * --v_A and v_B (p3 & p4) are both set as -1.0, but v_A is used immediately after this native for:
 * "if (v_A < ENTITY::GET_ENTITY_ANIM_CURRENT_TIME(...))"
 * Both v_A and v_B are seemingly used to contain both Vector3's and floats, so I can't say what either really is other than that they are both output parameters. p4 looks more like a Vector3 though
