 * TASK:GET_SCRIPT_TASK_STATUS

 * 0x9B5C1660CCDF7189

 * If TaskName is chosen to be NULL the command will search for any scripted task that is being processed, rather than a specific task.
 * ReturnStatusOut should be declared as a SCRIPTTASKSTATUS. ReturnStatusOut will be one of the entries in the header file:
 * If you're trying to get the status of a task that is performed as part of a sequence then it will never return as True because the character in question is told to TASK_PERFORM_SEQUENCE.
 * So, check for GET_SCRIPT_TASK_STATUS ( CharID, SCRIPT_TASK_PERFORM_SEQUENCE, ReturnStatus) instead.
 * Alternatively, you can check to see if a character is performing a sequence then use GET_SEQUENCE_PROGRESS to find out which specific task within the sequence your character is performing.
 * Gets the status of a script-assigned task.
