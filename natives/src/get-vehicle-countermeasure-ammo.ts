 * Gets the current countermeasure ammo count for a script vehicle.
 * Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.
 * Similar to `GET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO`, this gets the amount of countermeasures that are present on this vehicle.
 * Use SET_VEHICLE_COUNTERMEASURE_AMMO to set the current amount.
