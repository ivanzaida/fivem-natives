 * 0xCF9D3F0358793BA8

 * Gets the current state of a vehicle crew emblem request made using ADD_VEHICLE_CREW_EMBLEM
 * CERS_NOT_ACTIVE			- means that an error has occured as no request is found for this vehicle
 * CERS_REQUESTING_BADGE	- means that the request is still in progress (still requesting the texture from the cloud)
 * CERS_APPLYING_DECAL		- means that the request is still in progress (still applying the decal)
 * CERS_SUCCEEDED			- means that the request has succeeded
 * CERS_FAILED				- means that the request has failed
 * Note that if CERS_SUCCEEDED or CERS_FAILED are returned the request will automatically be made not active (CERS_NOT_ACTIVE) so querying it again will produce an error
