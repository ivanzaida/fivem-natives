 * Use this to check if a particyular event tag is present in an animation playing on the entity this frame
 * Some events are instantaneous (so this will only return true once). Others may have duration, which means that
 * this function may continuously return true for a range of values. The event must have been tagged with the VisibleToScript attribute
 * to make it detectable with this command. Events can include one or more attributes of different types that can be used
 * to get data from the animation. To get the value of an attribute, use the GET_X_ATTRIBUTE_FROM_ANIM_EVENT commands below.
