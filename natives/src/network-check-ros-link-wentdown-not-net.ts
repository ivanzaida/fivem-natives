 * Call to retrieve if in the last session the ROS connection (cloud) went down but not the platform network connection.
 * When this is called it will clear any status so this must be called in the network game once only. During transition from SP to MP since
 * I will adding some asserts and checks to make sure this is done in FREEMODE.
 * Returns true if profile setting 901 is set to true and sets it to false.
