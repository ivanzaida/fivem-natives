 *
 * 0x26A3263324259353

 * This will transition back to freemode from a launched activity session.
 * All players returning to freemode should call this (including a quit)
 * This takes an array of gamer handles of players that we should take with us.
 * Specify 0 for nNumGamers to quit back solo
 * nMaxPlayers is used if we cannot find a match and need to host.
 * p2 is true 3/4 of the occurrences I found.
 * 'players' is the number of players for a session. On PS3/360 it's always 18. On PC it's 32.
