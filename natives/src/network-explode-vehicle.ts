 * NETWORK:NETWORK_EXPLODE_VEHICLE
 *
 * 0xC392361DCE030EF4

 * In the console script dumps, this is only referenced once.
 * NETWORK::NETWORK_EXPLODE_VEHICLE(vehicle, 1, 0, 0);
 * ^^^^^ That must be PC script dumps? In X360 Script Dumps it is reference a few times with 2 differences in the parameters.
 * Which as you see below is 1, 0, 0 + 1, 1, 0 + 1, 0, and a param?
 * am_plane_takedown.c
 * network_explode_vehicle(net_to_veh(Local_40.imm_2), 1, 1, 0);
 * armenian2.c
 * network_explode_vehicle(Local_80[6 <2>], 1, 0, 0);
 * fm_horde_controler.c
 * network_explode_vehicle(net_to_veh(uParam0), 1, 0, uParam0);
 * fm_mission_controller.c, has 6 hits so not going to list them.
 * Side note, setting the first parameter to 0 seems to mute sound or so?
 * Seems it's like ADD_EXPLOSION, etc. the first 2 params. The 3rd atm no need to worry since it always seems to be 0.
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @param {VehicleIndex} vehicle
 * @param {boolean} addExplosion
 * @param {boolean} keepDamageEntity
 * @param {number} culprit
 * @returns {boolean}
