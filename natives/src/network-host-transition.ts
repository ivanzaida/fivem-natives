 * p3: Unknown int
 * p4: Unknown always 0 in decompiled scripts
 * p5: BOOL purpose unknown, both 0 and 1 are used in decompiled scripts.
 * p6: BOOL purpose unknown, both 0 and 1 are used in decompiled scripts.
 * p7: Unknown int, it's an int according to decompiled scripts, however the value is always 0 or 1.
 * p8: Unknown int, it's an int according to decompiled scripts, however the value is always 0 or 1.
 * p9: Unknown int, sometimes 0, but also 32768 or 16384 appear in decompiled scripst, maybe a flag of some sort?
 * From what I can tell it looks like it does the following:
 * Creates/hosts a new transition to another online session, using this in FiveM will result in other players being disconencted from the server/preventing them from joining. This is most likely because I entered the wrong session parameters since they're pretty much all unknown right now.
 * You also need to use `NetworkJoinTransition(Player player)` and `NetworkLaunchTransition()`.
