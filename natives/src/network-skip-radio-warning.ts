 * The name of this function is intentionally incorrect.
 * This function returns true if the game has naively, though successfully, detected mods attached to the game.
 * This function returns false if the game has NOT detected mods attached to the game (again through an over-simplistic and naive detection)
 * Returns true if dinput8.dll is present in the game directory.
 * You will get following error message if that is true: "You are attempting to access GTA Online servers with an altered version of the game."
