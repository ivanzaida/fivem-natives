 * Note that prop data set with SET_PED_PRELOAD_PROP_DATA counts towards the script memory budget.
 * For this reason it is important to use this command to release these assets as soon as you don't need them anymore.
 * In fact, you can call this command as soon as you have set the same prop with SET_PED_PROP_INDEX
 * since at that point the assets will be rendered on the ped and have references to keep them in memory.
