 * Instead, before calling this function, you may want to declare the position, where your Resurrected ped to be spawn at.(For instance, Around 2 floats of Player's current position.)
 * Also, disabling any assigned task immediately helped in the number of scenarios, where If you want peds to perform certain decided tasks.
