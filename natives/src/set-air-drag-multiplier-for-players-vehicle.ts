 * Force higher air drag mult on any car or bike the player uses until the mission ends or this command is called again with 1.0, fDragMult range 1.0 - 15.0  (5.0 is standard for high air resistance zones on the map)
 * This can be between 1.0f - 14.9f
 * You can change the max in IDA from 15.0. I say 15.0 as the function blrs if what you input is greater than or equal to 15.0 hence why it's 14.9 max default.
