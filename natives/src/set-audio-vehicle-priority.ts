 * AUDIO:SET_AUDIO_VEHICLE_PRIORITY
 *
 * 0xF8B40A38F93CE540

 * Sets the priority for the given vehicle. This is a hint for the audio system as to what LOD the
 * vehicle should use. 'High' priority will bump up the activation range significantly and prevent it
 * from dropping when the vehicle is not within the view frustrum. 'Max' will attempt to keep the vehicle
 * at maximum LOD regardless of how far it is from the listener or what it is currently doing. Be careful with this!
 * There is a hard limit of 5 simulataneous granular cars (including the player) so we are quite limited on the number
 * we can play at once, so setting vehicles to max priority will reduce the number of engines availble for regular NPC vehicles
 *
