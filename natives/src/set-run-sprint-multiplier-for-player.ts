 * Multiplier goes up to 1.49 any value above will be completely overruled by the game and the multiplier will not take effect, this can be edited in memory however.
 * Just call it one time, it is not required to be called once every tick.
 * Note: At least the IDA method if you change the max float multiplier from 1.5 it will change it for both this and SWIM above. I say 1.5 as the function blrs if what you input is greater than or equal to 1.5 hence why it's 1.49 max default.
