 * Enable or disable forced prestreaming for cutscenes. If enabled, the SRL will always preload map data for the first
 * frame of a cutscene, even if it is far away. BE CAREFUL when using this function. Only use it when you are CERTAIN
 * that the current camera position and the first frame of the cutscene can't get too far away, and when you're certain
 * that the two scenes are not particularly rich in entities. Otherwise, you will crash with a pool overflow.
