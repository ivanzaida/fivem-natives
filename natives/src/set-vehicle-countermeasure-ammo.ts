 * VEHICLE:SET_VEHICLE_COUNTERMEASURE_AMMO

 * Sets the current countermeasure ammo count for a script vehicle.
 * Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.
 * Similar to SET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO, this sets the amount of countermeasures that are present on this vehicle.
 * Use GET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO to get the current amount.
