 * This doesn't stop a piece of dialogue that has been triggered.
 * This stops the ability to force ambient dialogue if set to true - however setting it to false, then triggering a context, then setting it to true again will allow this.
 * Nb. This does not sync over the network, it will only affect peds locally. Use STOP_PED_SPEAKING_SYNCED if you need to affect peds on other machines too.
