 * TASK:TASK_CLIMB_LADDER
 *
 * 0x52210330D36ACD48

 * This command handles everything needed to make a ped get on a ladder at the top or bottom, climb/descend it,
 * and get off at the other end. The task decides whether the ped is supposed to climb or descend by examining which end of the ladder is nearest.
 * The ped needs to be positioned right next to the ladder they are supposed to use, and should also be facing it.
 * There are two possibilities for mounting the ladder - at the base of the ladder facing towards the front of it, and at the top of the ladder facing the reverse of the ladder. See the image below.
 * If successful, the ped will get on the ladder, climb, and then get off.
