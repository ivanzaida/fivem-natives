 * TASK:TASK_START_SCENARIO_AT_POSITION
 *
 * 0x634E47EF112F3802

 * Full list of ped scenarios by DurtyFree: https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/blob/master/scenariosCompact.json
 * Also a few more listed at TASK::TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE just above.
 * ---------------
 * The first parameter in every scenario has always been a Ped of some sort. The second like TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE is the name of the scenario.
 * The next 4 parameters were harder to decipher. After viewing "hairdo_shop_mp.ysc.c4", and being confused from seeing the case in other scripts, they passed the first three of the arguments as one array from a function, and it looked like it was obviously x, y, and z.
 * I haven't seen the sixth parameter go to or over 360, making me believe that it is rotation, but I really can't confirm anything.
 * I have no idea what the last 3 parameters are, but I'll try to find out.
 * -going on the last 3 parameters, they appear to always be "0, 0, 1"
 * p6 -1 also used in scrips
 * p7 used for sitting scenarios
 * p8 teleports ped to position
