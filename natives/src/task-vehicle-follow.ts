 * TASK:TASK_VEHICLE_FOLLOW

 * 0x1114FB0D0DF739D0

 * This task sits sort of in between TASK_VEHICLE_ESCORT and TASK_VEHICLE_CHASE.
 * Not as fine-controlled as ESCORT but not as aggressive as CHASE.
 * This task is preferable to ESCORT when the following vehicle might start off in front
 * of the thing it's supposed to follow
 * Tells a vehicle to follow another entity
 * Makes a ped in a vehicle follow an entity (ped, vehicle, etc.)
